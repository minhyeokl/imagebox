                    text generation was suddenly brought to light, despite having been available for three years. The
                    ChatGPT interface showcased the potential of such language models, and suddenly developers and
                    inventors began to realize the incredible possibilities available at their fingertips.</p>
                <p>The field of natural language processing has made incredible technical progress over the years, but
                    until recently, use of the technology was limited to an elite few. The OpenAI API and its
                    accompanying libraries provide a ready-to-use solution for anyone seeking to build AI-powered
                    applications. There is no need to have powerful hardware or deep knowledge of artificial
                    intelligence; with just a few lines of code, developers can integrate incredible features into their
                    projects at a reasonable cost.</p>
                <p>We combine our knowledge and experience, Olivier as a data scientist and Marie-Alice as a software
                    engineer, to give you a broad understanding of how to develop applications with GPT-4 and ChatGPT.
                    In these pages, you will find clear and detailed explanations of AI concepts, as well as
                    user-friendly guidelines on how to integrate the OpenAI services effectively, securely, and
                    cost-consciously.</p>
                <p>This book is designed to be accessible to all, but some basic Python knowledge is preferred. Through
                    clear explanations, example projects, and step-by-step instructions, we invite you to discover with
                    us how GPT-4 and ChatGPT can transform the way we interact with machines.</p>

                            the help of many people. We would like to thank the incredible O’Reilly team for their
